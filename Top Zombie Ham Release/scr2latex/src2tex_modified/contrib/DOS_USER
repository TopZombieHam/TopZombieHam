To: DOS_USERs,

[1] Some compilers do not accept unix files, and you may need to convert
the source files to dos text files.  And you need to modify the makefile
unless you use GCC.

[2] The behaviour of dos-version of src2tex is different from that of unix-
version. It produces "sample.tex" from "sample.c" instead of "sample.c.tex".
This is not a serious problem in general, but read the following carefully!

o src2tex can be used to pretty-print a TeX source file. But >>never<< try :
     src2tex input.tex
  unless you want to lose your TeX file!  Anyway src2tex will fail in
  converting from src to tex.

o src2tex can be used to pretty-print a text file with the extension .log.
  src2tex will produce the desired .tex file.  But >>never<< tex the .tex
  file in the same directory unless you want to lose the original .log file! 

You can try :
     src2tex < input.tex[log] > output.tex
                                ^^^^^^(use a different name!)
     tex output
to avoid overwriting the .tex[log] file. [Note. Redirection is not
recommended for source files, since src2tex cannot use the file extension
information when determining the language.]

Or you can write a batch file which takes care of these special situations.
(You may need a tool to manipulate filenames and extensions in batch files.)

[3] src2tex(resp. src2ltex) produces a tex file which will input a style
file of the name "src2tex.s2t"(resp. "src2ltex.s2t") if there exists one
in the current directory.  This can be used to customise your TeX output
without touching the source file.  If you often switch the style files,
a batch file (say, "get.bat") like:
     copy c:\tex\macro\%1.s2t src2tex.s2t
might be handy to use (e.g., get a3 ).
