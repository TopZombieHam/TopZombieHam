Roughly speaking, src2tex [resp. src2latex] is a sort of text converter from
    BASIC, C, C++, OBJECTIVE-C, COBOL, FORTRAN, HTML, JAVA,
    LISP, MAKE, PASCAL, PERL, SCHEME, SHELL, TCL/TK
and
    ASIR, MACSYMA, MAPLE, MATHEMATICA, MATLAB, MAXIMA,
    MuPAD, OCTAVE, REDUCE
to TeX [resp. LaTeX]. However, it is not a simple pretty-printer; actually, it
is designed to fulfill the following desires:

(1) We want to write mathematical formulae in comment area of source
    program. For instance, it is convenient if we are allowed to use
    an expression

	r=sqrt(x*x+y*y);  /* radius $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ */

    or something like that in C, and also, the program become more
    readable if we can embed mathematical formula into comment area
    of REDUCE, such as

	int(x/sqrt(1-x^2),x);  % integration $\int{x\over\sqrt{1-x^2}}\,dx$

(2) We would like to patch PS or EPS figures upon source program. For
    example, if we can show a photograph with a simple phrase

	* See the following numerical simulation.
	*			{\special{epsfile=simulation.eps}}

    of FORTRAN, it would be very impressive and further, if we are able
    to say

	(* This program generates the following surface.
				{\special{epsfile=graph.eps}} *)

    in MATHEMATICA, it is quite helpful.
(3) We need a simple and easy-to-use tool which enables to combine
    documentation and manual with source program. Unfortunately, WEB
    is too complicated to a layperson, i.e., to a person who does not
    have any special knowledge of literate programming.
(4) We often have to translate our program from text format to TeX
    format when we want to quote our own program in research report,
    lecture note, etc. That is quite time consuming, so it should be
    automated.

Shell scripts src2tex2dvi, src2tex2ps, src2latex2dvi and src2latex2ps are
also included in this package.  They would be useful if you could modify them
properly. For more information, it is better to read DVI files src2tex2dvi.dvi,
src2tex2ps.dvi, src2latex2dvi.dvi and src2latex2ps.dvi .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*   Our source file src2tex-212?.tar.gz is first uuencoded, split into
    several articles and after that posted to fj.sources newsgroup. So,
    using cat and uudecode commands appropriately, you would get the
    original file src2tex-212?.tar.gz .
