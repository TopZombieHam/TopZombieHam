		Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

[Q1] How can I install src2tex and src2latex?
[A1] You have only to issue the following commands
	make
	make install
in the src2tex-212 directory, and you will find executables src2tex and
src2latex there. If you are a DOS user, it suffices to type simply
	make dos
In this case, you will get src2tex.exe and src2ltex.exe in the present working
directory.
<NB> The authors would be very grateful if you could type
	make report
and send them your /etc/motd file (if it exists). They think that this would
give invaluable information.

[Q2] Why don't you write online manual?
[A2] The usage of src2tex and src2latex is so simple that we don't think
it is necessary to write an online manual. In fact, it will suffice to input
either
	src2tex <source file>  or  src2latex <source file>
For example, a command
	src2tex hanoi.c
gives a TeX file  hanoi.c.tex  in the current directory. For more information
please input
	src2tex -help  or  src2latex -help .

[Q3] Shell scripts src2tex2dvi, src2tex2ps, src2latex2dvi, src2latex2ps do
not work properly. Is it better to revise them?
[A3] Maybe, you have to edit them. If you are not Japanese, you should comment
out those lines containing "nkf" and replace "jtex" and "jlatex" with "tex"
and "latex" respectively. For more information, please read src2tex2dvi.dvi,
src2tex2ps.dvi, src2latex2dvi.dvi and src2latex2ps.dvi files.

[Q4] Will you give some source files written in src2tex format?
[A4] Source files  farmer+hen.scm, hanoi.c, newton.c, simpson.c, popgen.red
might be helpful. Though their comments are written in Japanese, they would
illustrate how to write comment in src2tex format.

[Q5] How can I include macros and figures?
[A5] In TeX-mode, you can use any TeXnique such as
	\input ...
	\special{ ... }
So, please feel free to use any method you are always using in TeX.

[Q6] Is it possible, for src2latex, to use non-defauld style file?
[A6} Yes, it is possible. For example, if you want src2latex to output
	\documentstyle[twocolumn,12pt]{article}
and if you are a PASCAL user, then you have only to write a line
	(* {\documentstyle[twocolumn,12pt]{article}} *)
at the beginning of your source file.

[Q7] Can I use typewriter font in comment area as well?
[A7] Yes, you can write comment in typewriter font by using src2tex escape
sequence  \src2tex{...}.  For instance, if you are a FORTRAN user, it would
suffice to insert a line
	* {\src2tex{texfont=tt}}
For more information, it is better to read a postscript file src2tex.c.ps.

[Q8] How src2tex and src2latex determine language type of given source file?
[A8] First, they see file-name-suffix and identify language as follows:
	.tex, .txt, .doc	=>	TEXT
	.bas, .vb		=>	BASIC
	.c, .cpp, .vc		=>	C, C++, OBJECTIVE-C
	.cbl, .cob		=>	COBOL
	.f, .for		=>	FORTRAN
	.html			=>	HTML
	.java			=>	JAVA
	.lsp, .sc, .scm, .el	=>	LISP, SCHEME
	makefile		=>	MAKE
	.p, .pas, .tp		=>	PASCAL
	.pl, .prl		=>	PERL
	.sh, .csh, .ksh		=>	SHELL
	.tcl, .tk		=>	TCL/TK
	.asi, .asir, .asr	=>	ASIR
	.mac, .max		=>	MACSYMA, MAXIMA
	.map, .mpl		=>	MAPLE
	.mat, .mma		=>	MATHEMATICA
	.ml, .mtlb, .oct	=>	MATLAB, OCTAVE
	.mu			=	MuPAD
	.red, .rdc		=>	REDUCE
Next, they search key words and attempt to determine language. Unfortunately,
the mechanism of automatic language detemination is not complete yet.

[Q9] It looks that src2tex output unnecessary \if's at the beginning of TeX
file. Can I remove them?
[A9] Yes, you can. Please just replace
	#define ASCII
	#define NTT
with
	#undef ASCII
	#undef NTT
in  src2tex.h  and make a recompilation.

[Q10] When I write a comment of the form
	* ----------------------------- *
	*         SUBROUTINE1           *
	*       1'st pde solver         *
	* ----------------------------- *
in FORTRAN program, I often get unexpected output
	* ----------------------------- *
	*           SUBROUTINE1             *
	*      1'st pde solver        *
	* ----------------------------- *
or something like that. Is it a bug of src2tex?
[A10] No, it is not a bug. Actually, src2tex is just trying to print the
comment in pretty proportion with cmr font. In this case, it would be better
to use \hfill escape sequence, such as
	* {\hrulefill} *
	* {\hfill SUBROUTINE1 \hfill} *
	* {\hfill 1'st pde solver \hfill} *
	* {\hrulefill} *
Generally speaking, it would be convenient if you could define your favorite
tabulation style in  src2tex.s2t  file by using \settabs escape sequence or
something like that.

[Q11] Where do I have to put src2tex.s2t and src2latex.s2t files?
[A11] You can put those files in the same directory where you find plain TeX
input-files  *.tex  and LaTeX style-files  *.sty .  As is well-known, you can
modify those search-directories.

[Q12] Can I print line numbers?
[A12] There are dirty tricks
	src2tex -0 <filenames>
	src2latex -0 <filenames> .
If you want to print <n> lines on each page,
	src2tex -<n>  <filenames>
	src2latex -<n>  <filenames>
commands would be useful.

[Q13] Can I print a certain key word in bold type font?
[A13] Yes, you can. It would be better to use sed, perl or something like that.
For example, if you want to print
	main()
function of  sample.c  file in bold type font, it will suffice to type
	src2tex sample.c
	sed -e s/main()/{\\bf main()}/g sample.c.tex > sample.tex
	tex sample.tex
You can modify several given words simultaneously, if you are familiar with sed
script (cf., for example, c2tex and c2tex.sed).
Furthermore, any <keyword> in program area is translated into a string
	}<keyword>{
by src2tex. This property is very useful when you modify the src2tex-output
into your favorite style.
